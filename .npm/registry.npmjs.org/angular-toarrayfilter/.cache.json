Moreover, filters like `filter` and `orderBy`\njust don't work with objects; they are designed to work with arrays.\n\nThis filter can convert your objects into stable arrays that can then be filtered and\nsorted using the standard AngularJS filters.\n\n## Get It\n\nThe easiest way to install is using [bower][bower]:\n\n```\nbower install --save angular-toArrayFilter\n```\n\nAlternatively you can download from the GitHub project:\n[https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter](https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter)\n\n## Load It\n\nLoad the `toArrayFilter.js` file into your web app after loading `angular.js`\n\n```html\n<html>\n  ...\n  <head>\n    ...\n    <script src=\"angular.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"bower_components/angular-toArrayFilter/toArrayFilter.js\"></script>\n    ...\n  </head>\n  ...\n</html>\n```\n\n## Use It\n\nMake sure that your AngularJS application references the `angular-toArrayFilter` module:\n\n```\nangular.module('myApp', ['angular-toArrayFilter']);\n```\n\nNow if you have an object that you wish to repeat over, just slip the `toArray` filter in\nbefore you try sorting or filtering:\n\n```html\n<div ng-repeat=\"item in itemObj | toArray | orderBy : 'someProp'\">\n  {{ item.$key }} - {{ item.someProp }}\n</div>\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe filter iterates over the object's keys and creates an array containing the value of each\nproperty. By default, the filter also attaches a new property `$key` to the value containing\nthe original key that was used in the object we are iterating over to reference the property.\n\n\n## Not adding the `$key` property\n\nIf you don't want the `$key` property to be attached to each of the property values, you simply\nput an additional parameter on the `toArray` filter:\n\n```html\n<div ng-repeat=\"item in itemObj | toArray : false | orderBy : 'someProp'\">\n  {{ item.someProp }} (no $key available now)\n</div>\n```\n\n## Using `$key` with non-objects\n\nNon-objects such as strings and numbers cannot have a new `$key` property attached to them.\nIf the object properties you are iterating over are not objects then you must either disable\nthe `$key` property or the filter will replace the non-object with a new object of the form:\n`{ $key: key, $value: value }`.\n\n\n## Caveats\n\nThere are always issues when trying to iterate over properties in JavaScript and the `toArray`\nfilter has its own set of things to be aware of when using it:\n\n* It only works with plain Objects - don't try to filter arrays and strings with it.\n* If you don't disable it, the filter will modify each property value with a new `$key` property.\n* This filter is not compatible with IE8. (It uses `Object.keys` and `Object.defineProperty` which\n  don't work well or at all in Internet Explorer 8 (IE8).\n\n\n## Example\n\nHere is a fuller example of using the `toArray` filter on an object, to allow sorting and filtering\nby a `date` property on each property of the original object. It also demonstrates how you can easily\nupdate the original object and the array will stay in sync.\n\nCheck out the [Live Demo][live-demo]\n\n\n**index.html:**\n\n```html\n<div ng-app=\"app\">\n  <div ng:controller=\"Main\">\n    <div ng:repeat=\"item in items | toArray | orderBy: 'date'\">\n      {{item.$key}}: {{item.date | date}}\n      <button ng-click=\"remove(item)\">Remove</button>\n    </div>\n    <button ng-click=\"add()\">Add</button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**app.js**\n\n```js\nangular.module('app', [])\n\n.controller('Main', function Main($scope) {\n  $scope.nextKey = 4;\n  $scope.items = {\n    0: {date: new Date('12/23/2013')},\n    1: {date: new Date('12/23/2011')},\n    2: {date: new Date('12/23/2010')},\n    3: {date: new Date('12/23/2015')}\n  };\n\n  $scope.remove = function(item) {\n    delete $scope.items[item.$key];\n  };\n\n  $scope.add = function() {\n    $scope.items[$scope.nextKey] = { date: new Date() };\n    $scope.nextKey += 1;\n  };\n});\n```\n\n[bower]: https://bower.io\n[live-demo]: http://plnkr.co/edit/G69YqKb9ag1qPLVqE6wz?p=preview","maintainers":[{"name":"petebd","email":"pete@bacondarwin.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-06-28T20:26:39.854Z","created":"2015-06-28T20:26:39.854Z","1.0.1":"2015-06-28T20:26:39.854Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter","keywords":["angular","filter","toArray","sort","orderBy"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter.git"},"author":{"name":"Pete Bacon Darwin","email":"pete@bacondarwin.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5590587f-18e6\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 20:26:39 GMT"}
